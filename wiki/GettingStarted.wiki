#summary Instructions on compiling and running the CRISP system.

= Requirements =

In order to build the CRISP system, you will need the following software:
 * Java SE 5.0 Development Kit or higher (get it [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp here], unless you have a Mac, in which case it should come preinstalled on you machine)
 * Apache Ant (get it [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi here])
 * A Subversion client (if you can't get one through the package management system of your platform, e.g. Cygwin, apt-get, etc., you can get binaries [http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html here]).


= Building CRISP =

Assuming your Java and Ant are installed properly, build CRISP as follows:
 * Check out the Subversion repository using the following command:
   {{{
   svn checkout http://crisp-nlg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Code crisp-nlg
   }}}
 (See also the [http://code.google.com/p/crisp-nlg/source instructions for checking out from the Google Code repository].)
 * Change to the new `crisp-nlg` subdirectory.
 * Build the system using Ant:
   {{{
   ant
   }}}
 The executable Jar file is now in `dist/crisp.jar`.
 * Run the combined converter and planner on an example input file:
   {{{
   java -jar dist/crisp.jar grammars/acl07/modifiers/problem-acl-mod2.xml
   }}}
 This should display a plan corresponding to the sentence "Mary likes the foo1 white rabbit" and leave behind the files `/tmp/crisptest-mod2-domain.lisp` and `/tmp/crisptest-mod2-problem.lisp`, which are PDDL input files that can be solved with other off-the-shelf planners.
